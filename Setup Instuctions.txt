Setup Instuctions:

1. Clone the Repository (or download project files)
If you're using GitHub, you can clone the repository with:

git clone <https://github.com/Dharsh-04/Patient-Symptom-Tracker>
cd <Patient-Symptom-Tracker>

If you haven't pushed it to GitHub, just make sure you have all your project files on your local machine.

2. Install Python and Dependencies
Ensure that Python (preferably Python 3) is installed on your machine.

Then, in the project folder, create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

On MacOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Required Libraries
With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to install all required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary libraries such as Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.

4. Set Up the Database
Before running the app, ensure the SQLite database is created by running the Flask app once to create tables:

flask run
This will set up the symptoms.db file in your project directory.

5. Running the Application
Now, you can run the application by executing:

flask run
This will start the Flask server, and you can visit the application by opening a browser and going to:
arduino
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
6. Test the Application
Open your browser and visit the URL.
You can start logging symptoms, check the recommendations, and visualize the symptom history.
